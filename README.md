**Known Limitations**
1. The app currently loads only the first page of top anime â€” pagination hasn't been added yet.
2. There's no search bar or filter option to look up specific anime titles.
3. Error handling for things like no internet connection or API failures is basic and can be improved.
4. The app doesn't support offline usage or data caching at the moment.
